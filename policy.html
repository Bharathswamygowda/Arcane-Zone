<p>Arcane Zone by Idbe Labs Ltd. aspires to change the way digital social interaction
  happens by ensuring the trust is directly established between the originator (sender) and
  recipients (receiver) of the message. Using state-of-the-art encryption methods, we take all
  necessary technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized data access
  and misuse. The processing and protection of data is carried out in accordance with
  applicable legal regulations and EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR).</p>

  <h3>1. General Information</strong> </h3>

<p>The Arcane Zone app (hereinafter referred to as &quot;AZ&quot;) is developed in such a way that it
  stores no data at the central server, except for the data necessary for securing the service
  and delivery of service. All information is stored on the respective subscriber devices. The
  subscriber is identified by a 128 bit Universally unique identifier that contains no
  information about the subscriber or their device. A set of cryptography key pairs are
  generated at the device, and the public counterpart of it is shared with the server to enable
  private and secure delivery of the service.</p>

<p><strong>AZ can be used without providing any personal identification information (PII) data.</strong></p>
<p>There will be options to link additional identity data like phone, email, etc when you
  purchase some of our premium services. When you purchase any of the services that may
  require personally identifiable data, you must confirm in accordance with Art. 8 GDPR that
  you are at least 16 years old or that you have obtained the consent of your legal guardian.
  By using the app, you agree to the collection, processing and use of data as described
  below.</p>

<h3>2. Purpose of Data Processing</h3>
<p>AZ processes data to enable the transmission of messages and multi-media to other
  subscribers on the platform. The processed data will be encrypted at the authoring
  (sender) subscriber’s device and flow through AZ infrastructure to be delivered at recipient
  (receiver) subscriber’s device. The data leaving the devices is encrypted using asymmetric
  encryption, and only the recipient can decrypt in their device. The encrypted data is routed
  using AZ servers hosted in the Netherlands governed by Ireland and EU’s data protection
  laws. No data is shared with any third party. If any rogue entity does manage to break into
  our system they would get no personal data, and any data they can get hold of while in
  transit will be encrypted thus rendering it useless.</p>

<h3>3. Scope and Duration of Data Processing</h3>
<h4>A. Inventory Data</h4>
<p>In the context of the use of AZ, the following information are collected and stored:</p>
<ul>
<li>AZ ID (logical identifier)</li>
<li>Nickname</li>
<li>Authentication Public key</li>
<li>Digital Signature Public Key</li>
<li>Encryption Public Key</li>
<li>Time of creation of the AZ ID</li>
</ul>
<p>When a subscriber sends a request to connect with another subscriber, following
  information will be available with the other subscriber:</p>

<ul>
<li>AZ ID (logical identifier)</li>
<li>Nickname</li>
<li>Digital Signature Public Key</li>
</ul>

<p>When exchanging messages, only the following information is passed on to other
  participants, after you have agreed to connect with them:</p>

<ul>
<li>AZ ID</li>
<li>Nickname</li>
<li>Digital Signature Public Key</li>
<li>Encryption Public Key</li>
<li>Messages that you send them, after signing them using your identity key, and after
  encrypting them using their encryption public key</li>

</ul>

<p>No information will be passed on to third parties, and no one except for the sender (author)
  and receiver (recipient) of the messages has any ability to read the content.</p>

<p>Account data will only be stored until deleted by the subscriber. Once the information is
  deleted, it cannot be restored.</p>


<h3>B. Message Contents</h3>

<p>AZ encrypts all messages, including control messages, using a highly secure asymmetric
  end-to-end encryption method.</p>

<p>Header information of messages (sender, receiver etc.) is protected by an additional
  encryption layer for transmission to the server, and from the server to the recipient, to
  prevent eavesdropping by third parties (e.g. in open wireless LANs).</p>

<p>Idbe Labs Ltd. as the operator of the AZ servers has no possibility to decrypt messages of
  AZ subscribers because it does not have knowledge of their private keys. All private keys
  used by the subscribers are stored in their device and can not be exported.</p>

<p>To facilitate delivery to recipient (receiver) subscribers, when they are offline, the
  encrypted messages get temporarily cached. These encrypted messages get completely
  deleted from the servers as soon as they have been successfully delivered. If the
  messages and media are not completely fetched, they will be automatically and
  irretrievably deleted from the server when the message reaches TTL (time to live). TTL is
  presently defined as 1 week. For non-premium customers there is a quota of 100MB
  cache. So when the cache is full, the older messages will get deleted. For non-premium
  customers there is a quota of 5000 messages. So when the cache is full the older
  messages get deleted. The cache will also get lost when the servers are reclaimed or shut
  down. There is no way for the server to retrieve any deleted messages, after they are removed from cache. The authoring subscriber will be aware of non-delivery, they will be
  responsible for re-sending the encrypted message to the recipient subscriber.</p>

<p>At AZ we keep no back up of data, except for our own operational data. <strong> From a
  subscriber perspective we sort of work in Database Less mode.</strong></p>


<h3>4. Data Processed by Third Parties</h3>

<p>AZ does not pass on any data to third parties, is completely free of advertising and does
  not use analytics software to monitor user behaviour. However, some functionalities can
  only be provided by using external data sources, frameworks or operating system
  services, which in turn process data and are subject to a separate privacy policy.</p>

<h4>A. Crash Notifications</h4>
<p>In order to improve the stability and reliability of the app, AZ relies on anonymous crash
  reports.</p>

<p> <strong>iOS / Windows Phone:</strong> AZ app is currently not available on iOS or Windows.</p>

<p><strong>Android:</strong> If the user voluntarily and explicitly consents to the general transmission of crash
  notifications to Google when setting up his mobile phone, information (status of the app at
  the time of the crash, stack trace, manufacturer and operating system of the mobile phone,
  latest log messages) will be transmitted to Google and stored there for evaluation by AZ.
  This information does not contain any personal data. Subscribers will be able to review the
  information before sending to AZ.</p>

<h4>5. Right to Information, Correction, Blocking, Deletion
  and Objection</h4>

<p>You have the right to receive information about your personal data stored by AZ at any
  time. Likewise, you have the right to correct, block or (apart from the legally required data
  storage for business purposes) delete your personal data.</p>

<p>The server stored information can be viewed at any time within AZ, in the profile section.
  This data can be updated or deleted by the user with immediate effect. A subscriber can
  obtain their data stored at AZ servers and can be obtained in machine readable format,
  after the subscriber has legitimately proven their identity.</p>


<p>In case of loss of the end-user device, AZ can not restore the data for subscribers, as all
  their data is stored only on their device. The device when encrypted will ensure protection
  of their data.</p>

<p>You can delete all personal data related to your AZ ID and revoke your key pair at any
  time using the options provided in the app itself.</p>


<h4>6. Responsible Body</h4>

<p>If you have any questions about data protection at AZ, you can contact us directly. Send
  us an email to info[at]idbelabs.com</p>

<h4>7. Amendment of the Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to comply with
  changed legal requirements or to reflect new functionalities of the app. The current Privacy
  Policy is always available for consultation from within the AZ app.</p>
